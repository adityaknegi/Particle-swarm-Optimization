# Particle-swarm-Optimization
Particle swarm Optimization(PSO)  used for solving optimisation 

1) Initialize particles with random position
and velocity vectors.

2) For each particleâ€™s position (p) evaluate fitness(eg Sin(x))

3) If fitness(p) better than fitness(pbest) then pbest= p

4) Set best of pBests as gBest

5) Update particles velocity and position

Stop: giving gBest, optimal solution.
